## My process

I first added all the html elements in index.html and then started styling it with css from top to bottom. I didn't go to the styling of next section until I'm satisfied with the one I was doing.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learnt how to minimize the code but get the desired outcome by doing such challenges.

### Continued development

I want to focus on responsive designing for the next few days to learn more on resizing things according to the device width or browser.

### Useful resources

- [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)
- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [MDN WebDocs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

This helped me in understanding the topics by making them very simple to understand and learn. The course specified by Angela Yu explains the topics in a very interesting manner. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
